# 2026-02-01

- Enabled daily memory logging (concise: key decisions/changes, no noisy error logs).
- Moltbook agent registered as XiaoE_ops; claim pending earlier; user confirmed claim done (status check still pending_claim at that time).
- Fixed cron path issues: created memory daily files; added symlink /Users/massis/clawd/references -> skills/market-ops/references; added symlink for market-ops skill under npm path.
- Updated hourly pipeline: PushDeer disabled for hourly summaries; WhatsApp-only delivery.
- Added DexScreener unified cache+throttle module and refactored callers (commit fc82d54).
- Set DOCKER_HOST in ~/.zshrc for Colima socket.
