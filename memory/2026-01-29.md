## Work log (market-ops)
- Added/iterated the hourly summary pipeline formatting for WhatsApp: reduced info overload, Top3 deduped OI movers.
- Added CoinGecko MC/FDV lookup with conservative symbol->id matching; hide MC/FDV when ambiguous/unmatched.
- Adjusted Twitter context filter to only require explicit symbol for ambiguous bases (e.g., PUMP) to avoid over-filtering.
- Introduced ccxt via `requirements.txt` and `scripts/hourly/exchange_ccxt.py`; prefer ccxt for OHLCV/ticker/OI history when supported, fallback to native Binance endpoints.
- Added on-demand command: `python3 scripts/analyze_symbol.py <SYMBOL>` (single symbol analysis, 1 LLM call max; rule-based fallback).

## Ops notes
- System Python is externally-managed (PEP 668). Use `.venv` for pip installs.
- GitHub repo `AnalyThothAI/market-ops-skills` is scripts+skills only; local state must not be pushed.

## Health
- Pill taken acknowledged at ~19:50.
